# Number-Guessing-Game
This small practice exercise allows you to work on:

The program will randomly generate a number between 1 and 100.

The user enters a number to make a guess.

If the guessed number is too high, display the message: "Too high".

If the guessed number is too low, display the message: "Too low".

If the guess is correct, display the message: "Congratulations! You guessed it!" and show the total number of attempts.

Concepts practiced:

Random numbers (Random)

Loops (while)

Conditional statements (if-else)

Input and output (Console.ReadLine() / Console.WriteLine())

Exception handling (int.TryParse)
